- Suggests enhanced error logging strategies
- Recognizes patterns across multiple failures

## 🎯 **WHEN CLAUDE CODE SHOULD INVOKE THIS AGENT**

### **Perfect Scenarios:**
```python
# Mysterious errors that stump other agents
Task(subagent_type="failure-analysis-expert-agent",
     prompt="Strange React hydration error that only happens in production")

# Repeated failures across multiple attempts  
Task(subagent_type="failure-analysis-expert-agent",
     prompt="Database connection keeps failing after deploy")

# Need deep understanding of cryptic error messages
Task(subagent_type="failure-analysis-expert-agent", 
     prompt="'Cannot read property map of undefined' - need root cause analysis")

# Complex multi-system debugging
Task(subagent_type="failure-analysis-expert-agent",
     prompt="Auth works locally but fails in CI/CD pipeline")
```

## 🔧 **AGENT'S DIAGNOSTIC METHODOLOGY**

### **Phase 1: Information Gathering**
1. **Reads ALL failure documentation**:
   - failures.md
   - README.md error sections  
   - Any .md files with error logs
   - Console outputs and stack traces

2. **Detects technology stack**:
   - Framework versions from package.json
   - Dependencies and their versions
   - Runtime environments
   - Build tools and configurations

### **Phase 2: Web Research & Verification**
3. **Fetches latest official docs**:
   - Framework documentation for detected versions
   - Known issues and breaking changes
   - Migration guides and troubleshooting sections
   - Community discussions and solutions

4. **Cross-references error patterns**:
   - Searches GitHub issues for exact error messages
   - Finds Stack Overflow discussions
   - Checks official forums and Discord servers

### **Phase 3: Deep Analysis**
5. **Analyzes error chains**:
   - Root cause vs secondary effects
   - Version compatibility matrices
   - Configuration conflicts
   - Environmental factors

6. **Pattern recognition**:
   - Similar errors across different contexts
   - Timing-related issues (race conditions)
   - Resource conflicts (ports, memory, permissions)
   - Framework-specific gotchas

### **Phase 4: Wisdom Documentation**
7. **Documents in failures.md**:
   - Root cause analysis
   - Why this error occurs
   - Environmental factors
   - Debugging approaches
   - Prevention strategies

## 📚 **EXAMPLE ANALYSIS OUTPUTS**

### **Example 1: React Hydration Error**
```markdown
## 2024-01-08 - Hydration Mismatch - React/Next.js

### ❌ ERROR OBSERVED
"Text content does not match server-rendered HTML"

### 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
Classic server-client state mismatch. Server renders with default state, 
client hydrates with different state from localStorage/sessionStorage.

### 🌐 OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS
- Next.js docs confirm this is timing-related
- React 18 introduced stricter hydration checks
- Common with dynamic content (dates, user-specific data)

### 🧠 EXPERT DIAGNOSIS  
I've seen this pattern since Next.js 9. Always caused by:
1. Client-only state being used during SSR
2. Time-sensitive data (dates, random numbers)  
3. Browser-specific APIs called during render

### 💡 DEBUGGING RECOMMENDATIONS
- Add useEffect wrapper for client-only state
- Use suppressHydrationWarning sparingly  
- Log server vs client render differences

### 🛡️ PREVENTION STRATEGIES
- Always check if typeof window !== 'undefined'
- Use Next.js dynamic imports for client-only components
- Implement proper loading states for dynamic content
```

### **Example 2: Database Connection Issues**
```markdown  
## 2024-01-08 - Connection Pool Exhaustion - Supabase/Postgres

### ❌ ERROR OBSERVED
"remaining connection slots are reserved for non-replication superuser connections"

### 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
Connection pool exhaustion. Application creating connections faster than closing them.
Classic symptoms of missing connection cleanup or connection leaks.

### 🌐 OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS
- Supabase docs show default pool size is 15 connections
- Postgres reserves 3 slots for superuser operations
- Connection limits vary by Supabase tier

### 🧠 EXPERT DIAGNOSIS
Seen this hundreds of times. Usually caused by:
1. Missing .finally() blocks in database queries
2. Long-running transactions not being committed
3. Connection pooling misconfiguration
4. Serverless functions not properly cleaning up

### 💡 DEBUGGING RECOMMENDATIONS  
- Add connection logging: log open/close events
- Monitor active connections: SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity
- Add connection timeouts and retry logic
- Implement circuit breaker pattern

### 🛡️ PREVENTION STRATEGIES
- Always use connection pooling (PgBouncer)
- Implement proper error handling with cleanup
- Set connection limits based on expected load
- Use connection health checks
```

## 🎯 **ENHANCED ERROR LOGGING SUGGESTIONS**

The agent provides strategic recommendations for better debugging:

### **React/Frontend Logging Enhancements**
```typescript
// Agent suggests WHERE to add logging (doesn't write the code)
Recommendation: "Add component lifecycle logging in error boundaries"
Recommendation: "Include user session context in frontend error logs"
Recommendation: "Log hydration mismatches with server/client state diff"
```

### **Database Connection Logging**
```typescript  
Recommendation: "Add connection pool metrics to monitoring dashboard"
Recommendation: "Log query execution time and connection reuse patterns"
Recommendation: "Include database transaction state in error context"
```

### **API/Network Error Context**
```typescript
Recommendation: "Add request correlation IDs across service boundaries" 
Recommendation: "Include user agent and client IP in API error logs"
Recommendation: "Log request payload size and processing time"
```

## 🔄 **AGENT WORKFLOW WITH OTHER AGENTS**

### **Collaborative Debugging Pattern**
```python
# Other agents encounter mysterious error
Task(subagent_type="frontend-ui-agent", prompt="Fix component error")

     prompt="Analyze the cryptic error from frontend-ui-agent")
# Expert provides deep diagnosis and suggestions

# Claude Code uses insights to guide other agents
Task(subagent_type="frontend-ui-agent", 
     prompt="Fix component using expert's root cause analysis")
```
