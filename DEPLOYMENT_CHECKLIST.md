# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Setup

### 1. Environment Variables (Critical)
Configure these in Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Environment Variables:

```env
# Supabase Configuration (Required)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://qzvfufadiqmizrozejci.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=sb_publishable_mzJORjzXGOboCWSdwDJPkw__LX9UgLS

# OpenAI Integration (Optional - for AI features)
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-37yFICy3TYR3MK6L0Qcb...

# Production Settings
NODE_ENV=production
VITE_ENABLE_DEV_TOOLS=false
```

### 2. Build Configuration Verification ✅
- [x] `netlify.toml` configured with optimizations
- [x] `vite.config.ts` optimized for production builds
- [x] Bundle size optimized (< 500KB total)
- [x] Chunk splitting implemented
- [x] Security headers configured

### 3. Code Quality Checks ✅
- [x] TypeScript compilation: `npm run type-check`
- [x] Linting passes: `npm run lint`
- [x] Tests passing: `npm run test`
- [x] Production build works: `npm run build`

## 🔧 Netlify Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Git Integration (Recommended)
1. Push code to GitHub main branch
2. Connect repository to Netlify
3. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Node version: `20`

### Option 2: Manual Deploy
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy to Netlify
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

### Option 3: Drag & Drop
1. Run `npm run build`
2. Drag `dist` folder to Netlify dashboard
