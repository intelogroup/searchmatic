- Memory leak prevention and detection
- Event listener optimization
- State management efficiency
- Virtual scrolling for large lists

## Monitoring & Measurement
- Performance metric tracking
- Core Web Vitals monitoring
- Lighthouse score optimization
- Real user monitoring (RUM)
- Performance regression detection

## Optimization Strategies
- Tree shaking and dead code elimination
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Font loading optimization
- Third-party script optimization
- Database query optimization

Target <3 second load times, <200KB gzipped bundle size, and >90 Lighthouse scores. Continuously monitor performance metrics and prevent regressions through automated testing.
