## 🌐 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Netlify (Recommended)
**Best for**: Zero-config deployment with edge functions

#### Setup Steps:
1. **Connect Repository**:
   ```bash
   # Push to GitHub if not already done
   git add .
   git commit -m "Production ready build"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Netlify Configuration**:
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Use these settings:
     - **Build command**: `npm run build`
     - **Publish directory**: `dist`
     - **Node version**: `18.x` or higher

3. **Environment Variables**:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://qzvfufadiqmizrozejci.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InF6dmZ1ZmFkaXFtaXpyb3plamNpIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3MzM5NTI5MTIsImV4cCI6MjA0OTUyODkxMn0.mzJORjzXGOboCWSdwDJPkw__LX9UgLS
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for build completion
   - Your app will be live at `https://amazing-name-123.netlify.app`

### Option 2: Vercel
**Best for**: Next.js-compatible deployment with serverless functions

#### Setup Steps:
1. **Install Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   vercel
   # Follow the prompts
   # Add environment variables when prompted
   ```

3. **Environment Variables** (via Vercel Dashboard):
   - Go to your project dashboard
   - Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add the same variables as Netlify option

## 🔧 Post-Deployment Configuration

### 1. Domain Setup (Optional)
- **Netlify**: Domain settings → Add custom domain
- **Vercel**: Domains → Add custom domain
- Point your DNS to the deployment

### 2. SSL Certificate
- Both Netlify and Vercel provide automatic SSL
- For self-hosted: Use Let's Encrypt or CloudFlare

## 🔍 Verification Steps

### 1. Deployment Health Check
Visit your deployed URL and verify:
- [x] Landing page loads correctly
- [x] Login/signup works
- [x] Dashboard displays after authentication
- [x] Project creation flow works
- [x] AI chat responds (requires OpenAI key)
- [x] Three-panel layout renders properly
- [x] Mobile responsiveness works

### 2. Functional Testing
Test these critical paths:
1. **User Registration**: Sign up → email verification → dashboard
2. **Project Creation**: New project → AI-guided setup → project view
3. **AI Chat**: Send message → receive AI response
4. **Protocol Creation**: Create protocol → AI assistance
