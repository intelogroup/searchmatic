# 🚨 MANUAL DATABASE MIGRATION REQUIRED

## Issue Identified
The service role API key has expired, so automated migration scripts cannot run. You need to manually apply the database migration through the Supabase Dashboard.

## ⚡ Quick Fix (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Access Supabase SQL Editor
1. **Go to**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qzvfufadiqmizrozejci/sql
2. **Login** to your Supabase account
3. **Click** "New Query" or use the existing SQL editor

### Step 2: Copy & Paste Migration SQL
1. **Open** the file `complete-database-setup.sql` in this project
2. **Copy** the entire contents (all 231 lines)
3. **Paste** into the Supabase SQL Editor
4. **Click** "Run" to execute the migration

### Step 3: Verify Success
After running the migration, you should see:
```
Database setup completed successfully! All tables, indexes, RLS policies, and triggers are now ready.
```

## 🎯 What This Will Create

### Tables
- ✅ **conversations**: AI chat conversations
- ✅ **messages**: Individual chat messages  
- ✅ **protocols**: Research protocols with PICO/SPIDER frameworks
- ✅ **projects**: Enhanced with 'type' column

### Security
- ✅ **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Users can only access their own data
- ✅ **Access Policies**: Comprehensive permission system
- ✅ **Data Isolation**: Complete user data separation

### Performance
- ✅ **Indexes**: Optimized queries for all tables
- ✅ **Triggers**: Automatic timestamp updates
- ✅ **Constraints**: Data validation and integrity

## 🔄 After Migration Complete

### Test the Database
Run this verification command:
```bash
node check-table-structure.js
```

You should see:
- ✅ Projects table accessible
- ✅ Conversations table accessible  
- ✅ Messages table accessible
- ✅ Protocols table accessible

### Test the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then:
1. **Login**: jayveedz19@gmail.com / Jimkali90#
2. **Create Project**: Test project creation form
3. **Use Chat**: Test AI chat functionality
4. **Create Protocol**: Test protocol creation

## 🎉 Expected Results

Once migration is complete, you'll have:

### ✅ Full AI Chat System
- Create conversations
- Send/receive messages
- Real-time updates
- Delete functionality
- Chat history

### ✅ Research Protocol System
- PICO framework support
- SPIDER framework support
- AI-guided creation
- Version control
- Search and filter

### ✅ Three-Panel Interface
- Main content area
- Protocol reference panel
- AI chat assistant panel
- Fully responsive design

## 🔑 API Key Status

### Working Keys
- **Anon Key**: `sb_publishable_mzJORjzXGOboCWSdwDJPkw__LX9UgLS` ✅ WORKING

### Expired Keys
- **Service Role Key**: ❌ EXPIRED (causes "Invalid API key" errors)

### To Get Fresh Service Role Key (Optional)
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qzvfufadiqmizrozejci/settings/api
2. Copy the **service_role** key
3. Update scripts if needed (not required for manual migration)

## 🚀 Why Manual Migration is Better

1. **More Reliable**: Direct access through Supabase Dashboard
2. **Better Error Messages**: See exactly what fails and why
3. **Visual Confirmation**: See tables created in real-time
4. **No API Limits**: No rate limiting or key expiration issues

## 📞 Next Steps After Migration

1. **Verify**: Run `node check-table-structure.js`
2. **Test**: Start development server and test features
3. **Develop**: Continue with AI chat and protocol features
4. **Deploy**: Features are ready for production testing

## 🎯 The Bottom Line

**Just copy the SQL from `complete-database-setup.sql` and paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor. Click Run. That's it!**

Everything is ready except these 3 missing database tables. Once you run the migration, your Searchmatic MVP will be 100% functional with all AI chat and protocol features working perfectly.

**Estimated time: 2 minutes to copy/paste + 30 seconds to execute = Less than 3 minutes total**
