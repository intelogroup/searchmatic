# Senior Engineer Technical Assessment & Roadmap

This document provides a senior full‑stack engineer's end‑to‑end review of the current codebase, mapped against the MVP and UI/UX specs, and a proposed roadmap to refactor and deliver a maintainable MVP‑1.0.

## 1. Codebase Health & Structure

### 1.1 Folder Layout & Boundaries
The current `/src` directory mixes pages, components, CSS, and hooks without clear separation. Adopt a feature‑slice + shared/ui pattern:

```plaintext
src/
├── app/                # Root wiring: App.tsx, routing, theming
├── pages/              # Route-level folders (auth/, dashboard/, migrations/)
├── entities/           # Domain-specific logic and types
├── features/           # Composite feature components
└── shared/
    ├── ui/             # Reusable design-system components (Button, Input, Toast, Skeleton, etc.)
    ├── hooks/          # Generic hooks (useDebounce, useToast)
    └── lib/            # API clients, logger wrappers
```

This aligns with the developer guidelines (DEVELOPER_GUIDELINES.md).

### 1.2 Styling & Theming
- Centralize theme variables (CSS custom properties or JS theme object).
- Move all visual styles into `shared/ui` component library.
- Eliminate inline and page‑specific CSS to enforce the design system.

## 2. Alignment with MVP Scope

Refer to MVP_SPECIFICATION.md (Sections 2.1–2.2) for in‑scope and out‑of‑scope features. Remove or disable any password‑reset, rollback, and social‑login code to avoid scope creep.

## 3. Frontend UX & Feedback Patterns

Based on UI_UX_DESIGN_RECOMMENDATIONS.md:
- Combine login and signup into a unified `AuthForm` component with a mode toggle.
- Implement inline field validation on blur and display errors via a global Toast/Alert system.
- Add loading states and spinners on submit buttons.
- Replace blank loading states in migration views with Skeleton components.

## 4. Backend & Services Alignment
- Trim rollback/down migration logic to only support “up” migrations.
- Propagate errors from services to the UI or centralized logger instead of using console logs.
- Ensure logging of key auth events and migration results per MVP spec.

## 5. Development Process & Onboarding

Follow DEVELOPER_GUIDELINES.md:
- Branching model and PR checklist.
- Pre‑commit hooks (lint, format, type checks).
- CI smoke tests gating merges on main.
- Update repository templates to reference the new docs.

## 6. Roadmap to MVP‑1.0

| Phase  | Action Items                                                                 |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Day 0  | Prune out‑of‑scope code (password reset, rollback, social login).             |
| Week 1 | Refactor folder structure; scaffold design system components; update styling. |
| Week 2 | Implement unified AuthForm; add Toast/Alert and Skeleton components.        |
| Week 3 | Build migration dashboard; hook up migration‑only logic; add inline logging. |
| Week 4 | Expand unit & smoke tests for auth and migrations (80% coverage target).    |
| Week 5 | Finalize a11y audit; polish theme tokens; release MVP‑1.0.                   |

This roadmap transforms the current codebase “mess” into a clear, maintainable MVP aligned with PM and UI/UX guidance.

## 7. Future Bottlenecks & Guardrails
Cross-reference **FUTURE_DEVELOPMENT_GAPS.md** to monitor and prioritize fixes for scalability, observability, and security gaps. Enforce design and scope guardrails via regular reviews against the MVP spec (**MVP_SPECIFICATION.md**) and UI/UX docs (**UI_UX_DESIGN_RECOMMENDATIONS.md**).
