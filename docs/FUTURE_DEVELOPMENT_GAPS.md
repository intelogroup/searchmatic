# Future Development Bottlenecks & Technical Gaps

This document highlights potential bottlenecks, architecture gaps, and areas of over-engineering in the current MVP design. Understanding these risks will help prioritize technical improvements in upcoming phases.

## 1. Scalability & Performance
- Single-environment deployment limits parallel scaling and fault isolation.
- Lack of horizontal auto-scaling for backend services under high load.
- Migration engine processes are synchronous; long-running migrations may block other operations.
- UI does not paginate or virtualize logs, leading to slow rendering for large datasets.

## 2. Observability & Monitoring
- Logging is basic; no structured metrics or centralized time-series storage (e.g., Prometheus).
- Absence of distributed tracing prevents performance bottleneck identification across services.
- No health-check endpoints or uptime monitoring to detect service-level failures automatically.

## 3. Security & Compliance
- Password-reset and email-verification flows (deferred) could delay compliance requirements.
- No rate-limiting or brute-force protection on auth endpoints.
- Audit trails and fine-grained access logging are postponed, leaving gaps for forensic analysis.

## 4. Codebase Maintainability
- Partial CSS and inline styles increase cognitive load; design system adoption is still in progress.
- Mixed folder structure before refactoring leads to duplicated logic and inconsistent patterns.
- Deferred rollback logic can become stale; reintroducing it later may require significant rework.

## 5. Over-Engineering Risks
- Early introduction of generic abstractions (e.g., feature flags, plugin systems) adds complexity without immediate payoff.
- Comprehensive test harness for social logins and multi-environment CI/CD may be premature.
- Excessive type layering and nested contexts can hinder new contributor onboarding.

## 6. Recommendations & Next Steps
- Define clear performance SLAs and build async migration processing for long-running operations.
- Integrate metrics and tracing frameworks to monitor system health end to end.
- Implement basic security hardening: rate limits, brute-force detection, and audit log retention.
- Finalize design system migration to eliminate inline styles and enforce consistency.
- Schedule a phased backlog to reintroduce deferred features, ensuring tests and CI/CD cover each increment.
