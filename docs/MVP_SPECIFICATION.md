 # MVP Specification

 ## 1. Purpose and Objectives
 - Provide a solid foundation for the migration and authentication platform.
 - Enable basic user authentication and migration capabilities.
 - Establish clear deployment and logging workflows.
 - Deliver a stable and testable product for early adopers.

 ## 2. Scope
 ### 2.1 In-Scope
 - **User Authentication**: email/password signup, login, logout, password reset flows.
 - **Database Migration Engine**: run and rollback basic schema migrations.
 - **Logging**: capture authentication events and migration status logs.
 - **Deployment Pipeline**: deploy edge functions and backend services to target environment.
 - **Basic Testing**: include unit tests for core modules and integration tests for auth and migration.

 ### 2.2 Out-of-Scope (for MVP)
 - Advanced admin dashboard and role-based access control.
 - Enhanced security logging and audit trails beyond basic events.
 - Comprehensive performance optimizations and load testing.
 - Multi-environment deployments (beyond a single staging/production setup).
 - Third-party social login integrations.

 ## 3. Success Metrics
 - Successful signup/login flows with a 95% pass rate in automated tests.
 - Migrations applied and rolled back without errors in 100% of CI runs.
 - Logging coverage for all key events (>90% events logged).
 - Deployment time under defined threshold (e.g., <5 minutes).

 ## 4. Timeline and Milestones
 | Milestone                     | Target Date    |
 |-------------------------------|----------------|
 | Authentication module         | Week 1         |
 | Migration engine core         | Week 2         |
 | Logging integration           | Week 3         |
 | Deployment pipeline           | Week 4         |
 | Testing & QA                  | Week 5         |

 ## 5. Risks and Mitigations
 - **Risk**: Scope creep due to many features in backlog.
   **Mitigation**: Strictly adhere to MVP in-scope list.
 - **Risk**: Junior team unfamiliar with codebase.
   **Mitigation**: Provide clear developer guidelines and code onboarding.
 - **Risk**: Deployment failures.
   **Mitigation**: Automated CI/CD checks and rollback scripts.
