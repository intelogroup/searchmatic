 # MVP Specification

 ## 1. Purpose and Objectives
 - Provide a solid foundation for the migration and authentication platform.
 - Enable basic user authentication and migration capabilities.
 - Establish clear deployment and logging workflows.
 - Deliver a stable and testable product for early adopers.

 ## 2. Scope
 ### 2.1 In-Scope
- **User Authentication**: email/password signup, login, logout flows.
- **Database Migration Engine**: apply versioned schema migrations.
- **Logging**: capture key authentication events and migration run results.
- **Deployment Pipeline**: deploy edge functions and backend services in a single environment.
- **Basic Testing**: unit tests for core modules and a smoke integration test for auth and migration.

 ### 2.2 Out-of-Scope (for MVP)
- Password-reset flows, email verification, and profile management beyond credentials.
- Rollback/down migrations and migration history dashboard.
- Advanced admin dashboard and role-based access control.
- Enhanced security logging, audit trails, and alerting integrations.
- Comprehensive performance optimizations, load testing, and strict >90% test coverage.
- Multi-environment CI/CD (staging, production, canary rollouts).
- Third-party social login integrations and OAuth providers.

 ## 3. Success Metrics
- Successful signup/login flows with a 95% pass rate in automated tests.
- Migrations applied successfully in 100% of CI runs.
- Basic logs captured for all key events.
- Code coverage of core modules at 80% or higher.
- Deployment time under defined threshold (e.g., <5 minutes).

 ## 4. Timeline and Milestones
 | Milestone                     | Target Date    |
 |-------------------------------|----------------|
 | Authentication module         | Week 1         |
 | Migration engine core         | Week 2         |
 | Logging integration           | Week 3         |
 | Deployment pipeline           | Week 4         |
 | Testing & QA                  | Week 5         |

 ## 5. Risks and Mitigations
 - **Risk**: Scope creep due to many features in backlog.
   **Mitigation**: Strictly adhere to MVP in-scope list.
 - **Risk**: Junior team unfamiliar with codebase.
   **Mitigation**: Provide clear developer guidelines and code onboarding.
 - **Risk**: Deployment failures.
   **Mitigation**: Automated CI/CD checks and rollback scripts.

## 6. Deferred Features for Phase 2
- Password resets, email verification, and social logins.
- Rollback/down migrations and migration history UI.
- Advanced admin dashboard, role-based access control, and audit trails.
- Enhanced security logging, alerting integrations, and compliance reporting.
- Multi-environment CI/CD (staging, production, canary) with automated rollback.
- Comprehensive end-to-end, performance, and load testing.
