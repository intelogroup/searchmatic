 # UI/UX & Product Design Recommendations

 This document outlines design recommendations for the MVP frontend, organized into four areas: Visual/UI polish, User flows & feedback, Product/feature priorities, and Next steps.

 ## 1. Visual / UI Polish
 ### 1.1 Establish a Coherent Design System
 - Define a consistent color palette and typography scale (h1–h6, body, captions).
 - Introduce spacing and layout tokens (e.g., 4px, 8px, 16px) for margins, paddings, and breakpoints.
 - Consolidate UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, form fields) into a shared library (`/src/components/ui/`).

 ### 1.2 Responsive & Accessibility Audits
 - Ensure all screens collapse gracefully on narrow viewports (320–480px), using media queries and a mobile-first approach.
 - Verify color contrast and add proper `<label>` associations and ARIA attributes (`aria-invalid`, `aria-describedby`) on form fields.
 - Confirm logical keyboard navigation and focus states, including form submission via the Enter key.

 ## 2. User-Flows & Feedback
 ### 2.1 Simplify & Clarify the Auth Flow
 - Combine login and signup into a unified tab or toggle interface to reduce navigation friction.
 - Implement inline field validation (email format, required fields, password strength) on blur events.
 - Surface error and success messages via a dismissible toast or alert region above the form.

 ### 2.2 Loading & Empty States
 - Show loading spinners or disabled button states during form submission to prevent double submits.
 - Use skeleton screens or placeholders in the migration dashboard while fetching status.

 ## 3. Product / Feature Priorities
 ### 3.1 MVP-1.0 Focus
 - Core email/password signup, login, and logout flows only.
 - Single “Run Migration” action with clear success/failure feedback.
 - Basic logs viewer listing recent migration runs and auth events.

 ### 3.2 Phase 2 UX Enhancements
 - Password-reset, email verification, and social login flows.
 - Rollback/down migrations UI with history and dashboard view.
 - Advanced admin dashboard, role-based access control, and audit trails.
 - Multi-environment CI/CD visual workflows and automated rollback on failure.
 - Comprehensive end-to-end testing flows and performance/load testing views.

 ## 4. Next Steps
 1. Audit & scaffold a design system (Storybook or markdown spec in `/src/components/ui/`).
 2. Revamp auth screens into a unified login/signup component with inline validation.
 3. Implement feedback patterns (toasts/alerts, loading indicators, skeletons).
4. Review designs with the team and iterate on wireframes or Figma prototypes.
5. Periodically cross-reference **PREVENT_DEV_GAPS_GUARDRAILS.md** to validate UI patterns and feature scope against known technical and performance constraints.
